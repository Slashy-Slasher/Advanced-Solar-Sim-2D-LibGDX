Advanced Solar Sim 2D LibGDX


# What is this Project?

   I've made several N-body simulations in the past, in a variety of different platforms, and many different languages, however, I wanted to start again with all the knowledge and wisdom from my previous mistakes. I call this rendition of the project "Advanced" because it gives the user far, far more to work with than my other projects, controllable ships, projected velocities, and collision projections. While I have plans to eventually add a dimension to this project, I want to perfect more of the core components I'm working with before I make the jump.





# Currently Implemented
   
  **Space Ship:**
   
   Directional Thurst: Applying thrust in different directions will have significantly different effects on your ship
   
   Warp Jumping: Pressing the [] key will warp your ship in a given direction, useful for escaping gravity wells

   Collision impacts: Your ship's onboard computer cannot predict where the ship is going to be based on its current position and the forces acting upon it!
   Optimized to prevent unwanted performance loss

   Added a screenshot of the projection



   **Planets**

   The ability to spawn planets during runtime

   The ability to track where planets have been in the past, using a solid line of the same color

   Selectable planets can be tracked using your ship's onboard computer, allowing the user to navigate to any planet in the solar system in a timely manner.
   
   **Camera**

   Pannable Camera based on the position of the ship

   Also controllable through MOUSEBUTTON3, allowing for the user to smoothly pan to see far-out planets
